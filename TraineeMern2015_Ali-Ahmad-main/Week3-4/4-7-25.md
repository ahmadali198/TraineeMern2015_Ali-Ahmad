## 🌐 Mastermind game:
This section contains my Mastermind game project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It includes features like drag-and-drop, duplicate checking, and feedback-based logic.  
Used DOM manipulation and event-driven programming.  
Implemented popups for success and validation checks.## 📜 DOM (Document Object Model)

The DOM represents the structure of a web page as a tree of nodes.  
We use JavaScript to dynamically create, update, or delete HTML elements.  
Advanced tasks include drag-and-drop, event delegation, and real-time UI updates.  
Common methods: `querySelector`, `appendChild`, `classList`, `addEventListener`.

## 🌐 BOM (Browser Object Model)

BOM allows interaction with the browser's features outside the page content.  
Used to access or manipulate `window`, `navigator`, `location`, `screen`, and `history`.  
Common applications include opening new tabs, redirecting pages, and checking browser info.  
Example: `window.open()`, `location.href`, `navigator.userAgent`.

## 🧪 Practice Features

- **Custom Alerts**: DOM-based styled popups instead of `alert()`.  
- **Popup Modals**: Controlled using `classList` and `setTimeout`.  
- **Timers**: BOM-based countdowns using `setInterval` and `clearInterval`.  
- **Drag & Drop**: DOM event handling with `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop`.

## 🧠 Event Delegation

Instead of adding listeners to each child, listen on a parent container.  
This improves performance and supports dynamically added elements.  
Used `.target` to identify event source inside handler.  
Useful in lists, dynamic buttons, or interactive forms.

## 💡 Useful BOM APIs

- `window.confirm()` – Shows a confirmation dialog.  
- `window.open()` – Opens a new browser tab or window.  
- `location.reload()` – Reloads the current page.  
- `navigator.onLine` – Checks internet connectivity.
