1. React Basics: Building with Components ðŸ§±
   Key Ideas:
Components are Everything: Seriously, almost anything you see on a React page is a component.

Functional Components: These are just regular JavaScript functions that return what looks like HTML. They're the go-to in modern React!
e.g:
function MyButton() {
  return <button>Click Me!</button>;
}

2. npm: Your Package Manager Friend ðŸ“¦
npm (Node Package Manager) is basically a massive library for JavaScript code. It helps to install, manage, and share all the JavaScript packages project needs.
Commands Use Often:
npm init: Sets up a new project by creating a package.json file. This file lists all your project's details and its dependencies.

npm install or npm i: Downloads and installs all the packages listed in your package.json file.

npm install <package-name>: Adds a specific package to your project. (e.g., npm install react).
npm install <package-name> --save-dev or npm i <package-name> -D: Installs a package that's only needed during development (like a build tool). (e.g., npm install vite --save-dev).

npm run <script-name>: Runs custom scripts defined in your package.json file. You'll often see npm run dev to start your development server!
3. Vite: The Speedy Setup âš¡:

Why Vite Rocks:
Blazing Fast Start: Seriously, it starts up almost instantly. It uses modern browser features to avoid bundling all your code upfront.

Instant Updates (HMR): Make a change, save it, and boom! It's instantly updated in your browser without a full page reload, keeping your app's state. Super convenient!

Simple Setup: Vite comes with great defaults and templates for React, making it easy to get going.
