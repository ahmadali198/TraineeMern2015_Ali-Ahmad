**🌐 How the Internet Works**
The internet is a global network of computers communicating via TCP/IP protocols.

Your device sends a request to a server, which responds with the required data (like a webpage or image).

**🧭 IP Address & Domain Names**
An IP address is a unique number identifying each device on the network (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

Domain names (e.g., google.com) are human-readable addresses mapped to IPs using DNS (Domain Name System). 

## 🔒 HTTP vs HTTPS

-   **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** transfers data between client and server **unencrypted**.
    
-   **HTTPS** uses **SSL/TLS encryption** to secure that data, protecting against eavesdropping and attacks.
