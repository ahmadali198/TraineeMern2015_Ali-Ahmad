# 🎯 Mastermind Game – JavaScript Edition

Welcome to **Mastermind**, the classic code-breaking game reimagined with modern JavaScript practices.

This project is a clean, modular, and fully interactive web implementation of the game — built with love and attention to code quality. It's a fun way to challenge your logic while exploring the best practices of doing JavaScript right.

## 🧠 How the Game Works

- The computer randomly selects a **4-digit secret code**.
- Your mission? **Crack the code** in as few attempts as possible.
- Each guess gives you:
  - 🔴 Count of digits that are **correct and in the correct position**.
  - ⚪ Count of digits that are **correct but in the wrong position**.
- Use logic and memory to narrow it down!

- 📱 Responsive design (play on any device)
