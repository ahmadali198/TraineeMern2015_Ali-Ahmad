## üìå JavaScript Best Practices

I explore JS concepts deeply and do more JS practices

### ‚úÖ Keep Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Instead of repeating similar code blocks, extract reusable functions.


// Bad
console.log("User logged in");
console.log("User logged out");

// Better
function logActivity(activity) {
  console.log(`User ${activity}`);
}
logActivity("logged in");
logActivity("logged out");
‚úÖ Avoid Global Variables
Use let, const, and block scoping instead of relying on or leaking to the global namespace.

// Not safe
count = 10;

// Safe
let count = 10;

‚úÖ Use Meaningful Variable Names
let x = 1 doesn't help anyone. Use descriptive names like let retryCount = 1.

‚úÖ Use Array/Map Functions When Possible
Avoid manual for loops if map(), filter(), or reduce() can do the job.
const prices = [100, 200, 300];
const discounted = prices.map(p => p * 0.9); // Cleaner and faster

üìö Advanced JS Concepts (with Real-Life Analogies)
1. Closures ‚Äì "The Coffee Shop Wallet"
A closure is like when you go to a coffee shop and load money onto a prepaid wallet. Even when you're outside the shop, your card still remembers the balance.

function createWallet(balance) {
  return function spend(amount) {
    balance -= amount;
    return balance;
  };
}

const myWallet = createWallet(500);
console.log(myWallet(100)); // 400
2. Promises & Async/Await ‚Äì "Food Delivery App"
Ordering food is a great example: you place an order (start async operation), wait for it, and then get the food (result).

function orderFood() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("üçï Delivered!"), 3000);
  });
}

async function trackOrder() {
  console.log("Order placed...");
  const food = await orderFood();
  console.log(food);
}

trackOrder();
