# 🔥 JavaScript Advanced Practice & Git Workflow

This repository includes my advanced JavaScript game project (Mastermind) and documents key Git practices like merge, rebase, and handling conflicts. Also includes notes on FireShare usage and collaboration via GitHub.

## 🚀 FireShare

FireShare is a Firebase-based file-sharing tool.  
Useful for quickly uploading, sharing files and testing collaborative features.  
Great for hosting images or JSON for real-time interaction in projects.  
Used it to transfer files or static assets during development.

## 🧠 Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts happen when two branches change the same line(s) of code.  
Git can’t automatically decide which version to keep.  
We manually resolve the conflict by editing the code, then staging and committing.  
Always check both HEAD and incoming branch before resolving.

---

## 🔀 Git Merge

Merging combines the histories of two branches.  
It keeps both sets of commits and creates a new merge commit.  
Useful for combining feature branches into main without rewriting history.  
Simple and safe but may lead to more merge commits over time.

---

## ♻️ Git Rebase

Rebase moves or reapplies commits on top of another base tip.  
It creates a cleaner, linear commit history.  
Ideal before merging to avoid noisy merge commits.  
Use `git rebase main` on a feature branch before pushing.

## ⚔️ Merge vs Rebase

- **Merge** preserves branch history but adds merge commits.  
- **Rebase** rewrites commit history for a cleaner log.  
- Rebase is good for small teams or solo work; Merge for shared/public branches.  
- Never rebase shared public branches.

## 🧩 Branching Workflow (Summary)

1. `git checkout -b feature-x` – Create feature branch.  
2. `git add . && git commit` – Make changes and commit.  
3. `git pull origin main --rebase` – Rebase with latest main.  
4. `git push origin feature-x` – Push to remote.  
5. Create a Pull Request – Merge or squash & merge.
